This repo is a fork of the [recastnavigation](https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation) pathfinding library add **deterministic** support.

I plan to regularly merge changes from recastnavigation main branch into this repo.

This repo is also used to compile recastnavigation's Rust wrapper [recastnavigation-rs](https://github.com/SlimeYummy/recastnavigation-rs). A little APIs changed to make integration easier. Deterministic tests is alse in Rust repo.
